# Bonsai.ML.Lds.Torch - Overview

This package provides an implementation of the Kalman filter, Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother, expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, and stochastic subspace identification, developed for online filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation from data streams in Bonsai using the TorchSharp package.

## Installation Guide

Install the `Bonsai.ML.Lds.Torch` package from the Bonsai package manager. You will also need to follow the [instructions for setting up the Bonsai.ML.Torch package](../Torch/torch-overview.md) for running on the CPU or GPU.
